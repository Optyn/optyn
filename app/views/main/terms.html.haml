    %h4 Optyn and the Merchant
    %p
      Optyn presents Marketing Information on behalf of a Merchant.  The Merchant shall be fully responsible
      for any and all injuries, illnesses, damages, claims, liabilities, losses and costs suffered by the
      Consumer, whether caused in whole or in part by the Merchant or its products and services.
    %p
      Optyn does not represent or warrant that any product or service promoted in Marketing Information or on
      the Site will perform as advertised or be available.
    %p
      Optyn makes the Site available to Consumers free of charge.  Merchants must purchase a monthly
      subscription to use the Site (”Merchant Subscription”).  The Merchant Subscription and all rights and
      privileges conferred are personal and non-transferable.  The following provisions apply only to
      Merchants:
    %h4 Merchant Automatic Renewals
    %p
      Optyn will automatically renew a Merchant Subscription on each monthly anniversary date of the Merchant
      Subscription and, as authorized by the Merchant during the Merchant Subscription sign-up process, will
      charge the Merchant’s payment card (either credit or debit card) with the applicable Merchant
      Subscription fee and sales or similar taxes that may be imposed on the Merchant Subscription fee
      payment.
    %p
      Each Merchant Subscription renewal period is for one (1) month.  The Merchant may cancel the Merchant
      Subscription at any time by logging on to the Merchant’s account within Optyn.com.
    %h4 Merchant Cancelation of Service / No Refunds
    %p
      To cancel a membership, the Merchant may login to its Merchant account on the Site and select the
      “membership options” link at the bottom of the page, then follow instructions regarding cancelation.
      All cancelation requests must be received by the first day of the month. Cancelation requests received
      after the first of the month shall take effect the following month. If you have any problems, please
      email: support@optyn.com.
    %p
      Optyn requires a reasonable amount of time to process Merchant Subscription cancelation requests. If a
      Merchant cancels its Merchant Membership, it may enjoy its Merchant Subscription benefits until the end
      of the then-current Merchant Subscription term, and the Merchant Subscription benefits will expire at the
      end of the then-current Merchant Subscription term for which the Merchant has paid. The Merchant shall not
      be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the Merchant Subscription fees paid for any unused
      days of the then-current Merchant Subscription term.
    %h4 Merchant Non Payment of Merchant Subscription
    %p
      Merchants must ensure that their payment card details (whether credit or debit) are kept up to date.
      If we are unable to process payment from a Merchant’s payment card, we will suspend access to the
      Merchant Subscription until we receive details of a valid credit card or debit card.
