      %strong Company Milestones.
      Have you had a recent anniversary, acquired your hundred thousandth customer, sold your 100,000 product?  Make sure that the announcement is interesting and people will enjoy reading about it.
    %p
      %strong Any New Hires / New Locations / Expansion Plans? 
      When a company grows its credibility increases. Plus, should you decide to highlight an emlployee or member of management you personalize your company.
    %p
      %strong Share Information.
      You’re an expert in your business.  Do you have any information to share? You may have discovered a new use for a product you sell.  Or maybe you recently conducted a survey. Or you could post a how-to video on YouTube and tell people about it.
    %p
      %strong It’s Not All About You.
      Don’t think that every communication has to be about your company.  Maybe there is a local event going on in the community you’d like your audience to know about, or a charity is conducting a food drive.
    %p
      %strong Give Something Away.
      Tell people about a product or informative white paper or anything they might find useful and give it away for free.  If the perceived value is higher than what you paid for it - you’re ahead of the game.
