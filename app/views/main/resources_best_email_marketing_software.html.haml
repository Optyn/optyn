      The short answer to what is the best email marketing software for your company is the one that fits your needs. There are a lot of email marketing software choices from the very sophisticated to the very basic.
    %p
      The sophisticated solutions often require a high degree of marketing or technical expertise. For example, with Constant Contact, you may be required to know HTML or CSS. If these acronyms are unfamiliar to you, youâ€™re probably not a good candidate for Constant Contact and other similar programs.
    %p
      If you are using your personal email to send emails, that is probably not the best email marketing software to choose.  Why?  Because although you may find it easy, it may not convey a professional image - and your target audience may not be inclined to even open the email.
    %p
      The best email marketing software might be a product like Optyn which focuses on delivery high quality profession emails that are easy to create, schedule and send.
