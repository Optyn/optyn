      Email marketing is very popular.  We have all been on the receiving end of marketing emails - some welcomed, others not so much. Regardless of how you feel about receiving them, the fact is that companies - including big national brands - use email marketing because it works.

        Email Marketing Is Inexpensive
      %br
      Compared to other forms of marketing, email campaigns can be delivered to your customers and potential buyers for just pennies.  This means you can communicate more often and/or reach a larger audience for what it would cost you to use another marketing channel.

        Email Marketing is Simple to Use
      %br
      Most other forms of advertising require you and others to get involved.  For example with direct mail, you need a printer, maybe a designer, someone to mail and or distribute the documents, etc.  With email, you can create schedule and send emails with do-it-yourself email marketing programs [weâ€™re partial to Optyn]  You can also put your campaigns on auto-pilot and have one company [Optyn again comes to mind :)] take care of all your marketing campaign needs.

      %br
      Email just takes the time required to write an email and press send - with Optyn it takes less than 2 minutes.  Responses to your campaign can occur with minutes.  What other forms or marketing do you know of that is that fast?

        Email Marketing is Measurable 
      %br
      Every aspect of email marketing can be tracked. From how many emails were delivered to how many persons purchased a product as a result of the campaign - all that information is available to you. This gives you an opportunity to compare the effectiveness of different campaigns and determine your ROI.

        And finally, one of the top reasons 
      for using email marketing is because your competition - and usually your bigger competitors - are using it. When asked why they use email marketing the vast majority say to increase retention, engagement and sales.  They are gaining in these areas at your expense.  Get in the game and start increasing sales.
