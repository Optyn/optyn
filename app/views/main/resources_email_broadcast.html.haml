      Make sure your email broadcast goes out to the people that have opted in to receive your emails. It’s important to send out emails to customers who have given you your permission as avoid spamming people. People think that emailing to millions of customers will give them big results and big $$$. You are wrong. We’ve been there, done it, and that’s not how email marketing works.

      Email Broadcasting should be done on a frequent basis. Create a schedule of broadcasts that will go out on a regular basis. This allows you to “train” your subscribers and they will be more open to receiving your emails. It’s important to note that customers who know you are more likely to buy from you. Customers who only hear from you seldomly, will forget about you and therefore convert less than your average subscriber.
