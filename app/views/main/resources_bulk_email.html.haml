    %p
      Bulk email is the email that is sent to many persons or entities at the same time.  Bulk email marketing is when those bulk emails have a marketing purpose.  It is important not to confuse bulk email with spam.  Spam is email sent to large numbers of individuals that is unwanted, irrelevant, misleading or inappropriate.  Bulk email sent to an audience that has opted in to receiving the correspondence from a trusted source is the opposite of spam.

      As a business owner marketing to your prospects and customers the best way to make sure your messages are not confused with spam is to send your email only to individuals who have elected to receive email from you and never try to fool your audience with misleading subject lines or content.  One final point, personalize the message so the recipient knows it is from you.
