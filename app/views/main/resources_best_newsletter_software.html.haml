      Many email newsletter software providers require the user to have some marketing and technical knowledge. Others might not require that level of expertise, but they might not have the functionality youâ€™re seeking. At a bare minimum, the best newsletter software should contain analytical tool so you can monitor the results of you campaign. In addition, there should be a mechanism by which you can segment your audience so you can customize the newsletter to the particular segment of client or prospect.
