    %h4 Welcome
    %p
      Optyn has a zero-tolerance spam policy and only allows Merchants and Consumers who comply with consent-based list collection methods to use our services. If, in Optyn’s sole discretion, it is determined that a Merchant or Consumer is in violation of this policy, Optyn will immediately terminate the account of the violating Merchant or Consumer.

    %h4 What is Spam?
    %p
      Spam is unsolicited email also known as UBE (Unsolicited Bulk Email). Unsolicited means that the recipient of the email has not granted verifiable consent for the message to be sent. Bulk means that the message is sent as part of a larger collection of messages, all having substantively identical content. By sending email only to those who have requested to receive it, you are following accepted permission-based email guidelines.
    %h4 What Constitutes Consent?
    %p
      The recipient of your email has been clearly and fully notified of the collection and use of his email address and has consented prior to such collection and use. This is often called informed consent.
    %h4 The Anti-Spam Law
    %p
      The federal anti-spam law went into effect on January 1, 2004, preempts all state laws, and make most spam illegal. The penalties can include a fine and/or imprisonment for up to five (5) years.

    %h4 How Optyn Protects Against Spam
    %p
      Optyn is a consent-based email marketing platform that follows the strictest permission-based philosophies:
      %ul.bullet-disc
        %li Contact Information — All emails are pre-filled with contact information including the physical address of the Merchant or Consumer as required by the CAN-Spam Act.
        %li Unsubscribe — Every email generated from Optyn contains an unsubscribe link, as required by law, which allows recipients of the email to opt-out of future emails. In addition, the email contact list of the Merchant or Consumer will automatically be updated so as to avoid sending unwanted emails to those who have unsubscribed.
        %li Identification — Optyn pre-sets the email header information of the Merchant or Consumer so that it is always correct. The "From" address is also already verified and accurately identifies the Merchant or Consumer as the sender.
        %li Communication — The Optyn sign-up page your contacts complete when joining your list states why you are collecting the site visitor's email address, how you plan to use their address, and that you are following the embedded privacy policy. Additionally, by accepting our license agreement you have agreed to use only consent-based lists (no purchased or 3rd party lists allowed).
        %li Verification — Optyn automatically sends all of your new contacts an email confirming that they joined your list.
        %li Choices — Optyn allows you to send both HTML and text based emails.
        %li ISP and Blacklist Relations: Optyn has standing relationships and ongoing dialogues with many of the leading ISPs and Blacklists. These include the sharing of information regarding policies, practices and issues. If you are an ISP, mail administrator or blacklist owner and would like to get in touch with us, please email support@optyn.com
