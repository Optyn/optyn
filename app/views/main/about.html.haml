          We started focusing on ways to help merchants increase sales years ago
          when we launched one of the first daily deal sites in Chicago.
          We’re now taking that expertise and helping merchants attract and
          retain customs through Optyn.

          As for making it easy for consumers to control emails and protect their
          private information – well, we’re consumers and we felt the pain.
          We developed Optyn based on what we wanted.  OK, accuse us of being
          self-serving, but admit it, you’re benefiting from a great product.

          Lou Morales bio goes here. Lou'st most annoying thing is that email marketing for businesses requires
          a lot of effort, resources, and probably a degree in E-Mail Marketing. Optyn will change that.
