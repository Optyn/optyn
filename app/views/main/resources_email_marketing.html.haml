        Email Marketing is Simple to Use
      %br
      Most other forms of advertising require you and others to get involved.  For example with direct mail, you need a printer, maybe a designer, someone to mail and or distribute the documents, etc.  When marketing with email you can create schedule and send emails with do-it-yourself email marketing software [weâ€™re partial to Optyn]  You can also put your campaigns on auto-pilot and have one company [Optyn again comes to mind :)] take care of all your marketing campaign needs.

Get in the game and start increasing sales.
