      One analytical tool common to all types of campaigns is Return on Investment (“ROI”).  This measure tells you how much was earned for each dollar spent.  ROI is calculated by dividing the sales generated by the campaign by the cost of the campaign.  For example, if you spent $200 on a marketing campaign and got $2,000 in sales as a result, your ROI is 10x.

      Marketing analytics also go beyond the specific campaigns of your company.  For instance, it is always useful to note if a prospect contact you what prompted him or her to make the call.  The marketing activity of your competitors should also be monitored to see what channels they favor and the marketing approach they use.

      The key to remember is that marketing analytics is a tool to help you manage your campaigns so you can optimize your marketing dollars.
