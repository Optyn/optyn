        1.  Make it known that coupons are available on your site.
      This will drive traffic and is a great way to grow your email list.  It will also generate immediate sales should the coupon be redeemable during that visit.

        2.  Generate a feeling of urgency by setting coupon expiration dates.
      The shorter the period until the expiration date the more of a sense of urgency the consumer will have and the shorter the buying decision process.

        3. Syndicate your offer.
      There are many sites on the web that aggregate coupons. Many of these sites may be specific to the type of coupon you’re offering so search around. Suggested search terms - “coupon site” or “[the type of coupon you’re offering] coupons”).

        5. Decide if the coupon is to be immediately useable or if a subsequent visit is required.
      As mentioned before, the advantage to an instantly redeemable coupon is immediate sales.  The advantage to a coupon that requires a subsequent visit is that you are incenting the consumer to visit again.

        6. Coupons don’t always have to be “Money Off”
      Coupon can be used to “redeem” white papers, admission to events or any other offer that doesn’t involve a cash discount. It can be a free product sampling, or new product trial. Be creative and it shall work for you.

        7. Post coupons in multiple locations.
      To increase visibility, post coupons can be in ads, on web sites and anywhere else that gets consumer attention.

        8. Make the coupon code memorable.
      If the coupon code is not consumer specific for redemption security purposes, use a memorable term rather than a meaningless alphanumeric string.  For example, use “SAVE$50TODAY” rather than “SDK98KJW9”. This will let customers easily redeem and most importantly share it with their friends so you can attract new customers.
