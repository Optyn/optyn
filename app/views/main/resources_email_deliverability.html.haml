    %h2 Getting the word out beyond the usual channels.

      When you syndicate something, you are offering it beyond the usual normal channels like email marketing and social media. Marketing syndication, therefore, refers to distributing your marketing campaigns across the web and beyond the typical target audience represented by an email or contact list.
    %p
      For a small business this can be a daunting task. Even if you use a marketing company to manage your campaigns, many don’t bother to do this for their clients because it is time consuming, expensive, and it is a complicated process.  Optyn is a great example of a company that does do it and, in the process, takes marketing syndication to new levels by maximizing the number and type of channels to which their customers have their marketing campaigns presented.

    E-MAIL DELIVERABILITY

Getting your emails opened and read.

Much has been written on the subject of email deliverability; from technical advice to practical tips.  This article will give you some general advice on getting your emails read.  Feel free to go beyond what is written here and learn more about the subject.  There is a wealth of information you can research.

Recognizability - Because people are more likely to open emails from senders they know and trust, make sure the name of your company in the From Label.  You can use the name of person in your company as long as that person’s name would be well known to the recipient.

Subject Line - The best rule of thumb for the subject line is to keep it short, descriptive and compelling - including the name of the recipient would help as well.  Now for some don’t dos: never mislead, don’t use all caps, and don’t go beyond 45 characters.

Preview Pane - Email recipients have the ability to view emails in a preview pane - a small space that shows the first few lines of the email.  The space is adjustable but is usually 2 inches wide by ⅔ inches tall.  The point is to make sure your most interesting content appears in the beginning of the email so the recipient will be compelled to open and read more.

Message Content - People generally scan emails.  Make sure you use short rather than long paragraphs.  Have links and calls to action throughout the email since it is rare that someone reads and email all the way through to the bottom.  
Images - If you’re going to include images, a good rule of thumb is to have 20% of the space dedicated to images and 80% dedicated to text.  Another point on images, the smaller the file size the faster they will load - try to keep the size to 25kb or smaller.  Also, make sure you provide alt-text to the images.  This is the text that will display should the image be blocked.  It is also what will be read by the screen reader for visually impaired recipients.
Test / Test / Test - As with all components of marketing, make sure you test different layouts, copy, subject lines and all the other variables in an email.  Over time you’ll understand what works for you.
