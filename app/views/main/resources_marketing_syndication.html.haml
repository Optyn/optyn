      When you syndicate something, you are offering it beyond the usual normal channels like email marketing and social media. Marketing syndication, therefore, refers to distributing your marketing campaigns across the web and beyond the typical target audience represented by an email or contact list.

      For a small business this can be a daunting task. Even if you use a marketing company to manage your campaigns, many donâ€™t bother to do this for their clients because it is time consuming, expensive, and it is a complicated process.  Optyn is a great example of a company that does do it and, in the process, takes marketing syndication to new levels by maximizing the number and type of channels to which their customers have their marketing campaigns presented.
