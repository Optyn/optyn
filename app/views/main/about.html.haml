          Whether you’re a consumer or merchant - are you overwhelmed by email?

          Too much? Too confusing?
          Not to worry!

          Optyn puts you in control of email marketing!
      %p
        We started focusing on ways to help merchants increase sales years ago
        when we launched one of the first daily deal sites in Chicago.
        We’re now taking that expertise and helping merchants attract and
        retain customs through Optyn.
      %p
        As for making it easy for consumers to control emails and protect their
        private information – well, we’re consumers and we felt the pain.
        We developed Optyn based on what we wanted.  OK, accuse us of being
        self-serving, but admit it, you’re benefiting from a great product.

          Alen loves creating products people want to use. Prior to Optyn, Alen built and sold Dealster, Chitown Deals,
          and other smaller businesses such as Dana Cafe and the Chicago Street Cup. He's an avid chess player and an
          All American and 2x National Chamption in Soccer.
        %p.description
          Alen's most annoying thing in the world is that people have no way to control and manage
          their information with companies. That's what we are here to solve.

        %p Co-Founder / COO

        %p.description
          Lou Morales started and ran businesses for GE, First Data and other Fortune 500 companies. In fact, every
          time you use that debit card in your wallet it is most likely processed by the First Data business unit Lou
          helped start.
        %p.description
          Lou's most annoying thing is that email marketing for businesses requires
          a lot of effort, resources, and probably a degree in E-Mail Marketing. Optyn will change that.
